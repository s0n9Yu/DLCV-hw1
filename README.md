## Introduction

In this homework, we are going to train a ResNet-based model to perform an image classification task consisting of 100 classes. The entire dataset has about 25,000 images of plants and animals etc. 
The main idea of our approach is to leverage the pretrained weights on ImageNet datasets, and to use an improved version of ResNet (ResNext) as our backbone.
